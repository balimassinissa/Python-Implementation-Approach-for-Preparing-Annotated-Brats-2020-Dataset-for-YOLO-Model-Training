# Python-Implementation-Approach-for-Preparing-Annotated-Brats-2020-Dataset-for-YOLO-Model-Training

To execute the code, simply follow these steps:

    # 1-Open a terminal.
    # 2-Type the following command: source myenv/bin/activate
    # 3-Launch Jupyter Notebook by typing: jupyter notebook

You can then run the code.

# Note: You may need to update certain paths for the code to work correctly.

Training:
For training, I use the modalities FLAIR, T1, T1CE, and T2. However, for this specific training, I will only use T1CE. Here’s the process I follow:

    # 1-Convert to PNG: I convert the T1CE images to PNG format.
    # 2-Resize: I resize the images as needed.
    # 3-Select the Best Slice: I choose the best slice, which is the one containing the most pixels.
    # 4-Start Training: I then proceed to start the training with the selected slice.
